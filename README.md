# QTracker
Bachelor's program graduation project that was developed by 4 students in 2020.

I was responsilbe for all PHP, and MySql aspects of the project.

The system has a self-registration mechanism for all users who are added to the system by an admin.

The project was a queue management clinic system where doctors, and receptionists have unique web interfaces where they can add patients to queues, and serve them.

Patients have a unique web interface where they can view hisotry of their visits.
Patients have a Android application that allows them to track their position in the queue alongside other queueing theory related statistics.

The project also contains an ER section that uses priority queues when serving patients based on what queue they were added to.
